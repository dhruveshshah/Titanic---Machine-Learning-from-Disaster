# Titanic---Machine-Learning-from-Disaster

This repository contains the code to apply various Machine Learning algorithms on titanic dataset and to build a model that would predict the survivors based on various factors like Gender, Age, Passenger Class, Family size and Ticket Fare. Additionally, I have visualized relation between different factors and studied their importance using ggplot2. This project various packages like caret - to apply cross validation, rpart - for plotting decision tree, stringr - to manipulate strings and doSnow - for parallel processing while appying random forest algorithm
